# ✋ Gesture Control with OpenCV, MediaPipe & PyAutoGUI  

Control your computer using **hand gestures** in real time with just a webcam! 🎥  
This project uses **OpenCV** for video capture, **MediaPipe** for hand tracking, and **PyAutoGUI** to trigger keyboard actions.  

In this version, raising your **index finger gesture** simulates a **spacebar press** — useful for games, slideshows, or hands-free interactions.
